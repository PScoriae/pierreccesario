## About
This server currently runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the operating system and is used as a test server for my projects before I deploy them to the cloud.

Additionally, it acts as a Type 1 Hypervisor with the use of Linux KVM. As such, there a few Windows 10 guests on the machine for anyone in my family to remote into if they need some remote computing power.

### Specifications
I needed the server to be economical as possible but with as much computing power as possible to support all the testing and sandboxing I have planned for it. I decided to go with decommissioned server parts as they offered the best performance per dollar.
