## About

This project, largely based on [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com), is a rather simple webapp that lets users save and share parts lists for custom PCs.

An important thing to note about this project is that the webapp is **not** the focus of this project. Instead, I am more interested in how the DevOps Engineering and Server Adminstration side of things tie in with this webapp. Things like CI/CD pipelines, Monitoring, Observability and general Cloud Engineering are what I'm passionate about so this webapp merely serves as a guinea pig for such DevOps processes.

With that being said, I did put in effort into creating the webapp as best I find programming in general quite gratifying. While frontend web development isn't my preference at all, it was a rather pleasant experience working with SvelteKit and was one of the primary reasons why it was chosen over other popular frameworks like React or Vue.
