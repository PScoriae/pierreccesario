TWICE is coming up to their 8th year now, triumphant over the dreaded 7-year curse that plagues so many groups in the Kpop industry. Throughout all that time, they’ve already established themselves as the quintessential Kpop girl group, especially in their home market. With this direction they're taking, I feel like they're trying to further cement themselves in the Western hemisphere with more palatable and less Kpop-like tracks since their core fanbase is already so strong. Gone are the days of bangers like _I CAN'T STOP ME_ or _LIKEY_. Sure, I’ll add some of the new songs to my playlist, but not because they’re amazing. Because they’re TWICE.

**5.5/10**
