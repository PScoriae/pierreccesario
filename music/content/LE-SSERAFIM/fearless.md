The EP opens with _The World Is My Oyster_, a mainly instrumental intro track that exudes confidence and gives the impression of the music played at a high-end clothing store. Production-wise, it clearly meets my expectations coming from a label as big as HYBE given that it excellently employs percussion and synths with various effects. That being said, the members do say things that attempt to add to the atmosphere, but ultimately end up detracting from the experience somewhat – it's a bit cringe. I get it, they're _Fearless_ but maybe they could've done it another way.

_Fearless_, evidently, is the title track of this EP. More of the same high-quality production is present here and, thankfully, it's a recurring theme throughout the EP. Where it falls short is that it plays things rather safe and doesn't seem to do anything special. Even the final chorus doesn't have at much impact as I would've hoped which makes it seem like the song gets cut short by the end of it. Sure, you can argue that it's the aesthetic the song is going for, being all _expensive_ and _unfazed_. To me though, it unfortunately makes the song somewhat unremarkable. I can see why they did it though. Release something like NMIXX's _Ad Mare_ for your debut and you're gonna have a liability on your hands. The music video, like the EP, is well produced and pretty but doesn't strike any chords either.

I think that the EP's B-sides are overall a much more enjoyable experience over _Fearless_ as you'll see me explain.

I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea what _Blue Flame_'s genre is but apparently it's has _disco-punk_ style, whatever that means. What I can tell you is that this is a definite improvement over the title track. The composition is much more intricate and the use of the bass guitar is much more prominent, along with the more comprehensive vocal arrangement. It features this snappy bassline but also has hints of sparkly synths to break things up a bit. Heck, there's even that cowbell on the side. The chorus switches things up with a more bouncy delivery before a wonderful harmonisation transitions you into the post-chorus' _"Will-O' the-wisp, babe Oh, baby, it's blue flame"_ It's all tastefully executed and a fun listen.

I'm a synth fan, so _The Great Mermaid_'s extravagant use of synths paired with its catchy melody were an instant hit for me. To fit the mood, the members' vocals were made slightly robotic with the use of a filter and I think it's a good artistic choice. The harmonies in the post-chorus' _"Na-na-na, na, na-na-na"_ married to the addictive synth basslines are a pleasure to listen to, even today. The second half of the track is particularly memorable with valiant performances such as Kazuha's deep voice commanding _"목소릴 버리라니 crazy 사라질 수 있다니 왜 이래"_ or Chaewon's superb delivery of _"I don’t give a shit! No love no golden prince"_ Fantastic.

Closing track _Sour Grapes_ portrays a more vulnerable and delicate side in this R&B arrangement. Its extensive use of delicate harp plucking to drive the beautiful melody is amazing and is something not seen quite often, at least in my experience. Then you have Kazuha's or Yunjin's serious, almost threatening _"Yeah you'll hurt me"_ to take you by surprise and spice things up, only to chill back down in the sublime chorus. It's great and keeps the experience varied.

Like I said, these are some pretty good B-sides, but the title track is unfortunately a serious let down. Nevertheless, I would still recommend it and is generally an above-average debut EP among the 4th gen GGs.

**7.0/10**
