ANTIFRAGILE marks the group's sophomore EP release. Like _Fearless_ before it, there are 5 tracks on this record. The album art also follows a similar layout with the record title and LE SSERAFIM at the top and bottom respectively – makes it nice for you to display since they're all so uniform. This time we see gold kintsugi cracked across a snow white backdrop. Obviously, this is an ode to the the EP's title. It's pretty but at the same time understated – I like it. Another change is that the entire record is now available in Dolby Atmos and thankfully, its implmentation is good. It doesn't completely change the way the tracks sound but adds some depth and dynamism to the mix which is exactly how it should be done, unlike the disaster that was IVE's _After Like_. The EP's lyrics in general revolve around accepting who you are and embracing your flaws.

_The Hydra_ is the intro track for this EP, though I much prefer this over _The World Is My Oyster_. It features thick pulsating beats and a multitude of effects alongside snippets of each member speaking in Japanese, Korean and English. With its quality production, it gets you amped up and prepared for the upcoming tracks, especially _ANTIFRAGILE_. It only shows up in the first half of the accompanying music video (which is actually the trailer for the entire EP). The other half is sadly not on the tracklist but I would've loved to see it on there. It features the same high quality runway-like production but with Yunjin's lyricism and vocals. Anyways, it's a solid track.

Alright. The title track.

I'm gonna be honest, I was averse to this song when I first heard it. I felt like it was somewhat annoying and, for lack of a better term, pretentious. I gave it some time. "Maybe it has to grow on me," I thought.

It grew on me. With its distinctly reggaeton and funk percussions, _ANTIFRAGILE_ is full of energy and definitely not the tame track that _Fearless_ was. It is catchy. **Very** catchy. The chorus explodes onto the scene with this sound effect you'd hear in games like Tekken to separate itself from the constant Latin inspired beats. A fun addition is the stereo play during the chorus with "ANTI" and "FRAGILE" alternating on either side with an almost stoic delivery that juxtaposes the rest of the song. The entire group's vocal presence is also much improved and carry just as much vigour as the already infectious melody. There are so many sections in the track that you can easily pick up and jam out to. Eunchae's delivery of, "Georeobwa wieom like a lion" is particularly fun to listen to while, _"잊지 마, 내가 두고 온 toe shoes"_ and _"무시 마, 내가 걸어온 커리어"_ are nice references to Kazuha's and Sakura's backgrounds. The music video's chaotic attitude and choreography is a joy to watch, not to mention the polish that we've come to expect from HYBE. Hell, I've even noticed that it feels short since it seems like it abruptly comes to an end. This plays to its advantage, though. It's a subtle way to keep you wanting more while preventing it from sounding strenuous and repetitive – very clever. I'm listening to it while writing this review and I can't seem to take it off repeat.

_Impurities_ is the next track and fills the R&B role. It actually surpasses _Blue Flame_ in my opinion. There's just a sense of higher quality and polish with this one. We even get a dedicated music video with it. It's very glamorous and exhibits much more flowy choreography to mimic the track itself. Direction and cinematography are top class. Most of the picture consists of one-shot takes and the 35-second long take at 1:02 is downright impressive. It's not easy to do that especially when you have choreography involved, let alone of 5 people. The production one that genuinely satisfies the cinema-geek in me. LE SSERAFIM and team have clearly been working hard and I need to give credit where credit is due.

With _No Celestial_, we see the group's first foray into a more rock-focused track. Good ol' electric guitars and drums encompass this song. Vocal delivery is great on this one with Yunjin taking the cake. You can hear all of them really enunciating the words in just the right way to convey, "I don't give a shit if I'm not perfect". On the CD and YouTube music versions, we even get to hear Chaewon belt, "I'm no fuckin' angel, I'm no fuckin' goddess" It's an oddly refreshing take on Kpop and I dig it.

The EP closes with _Good Parts (when the quality is bad but I am)_. Peculiar title aside, this is actually a great ballad. The reprise is particularly catchy and makes me want to sing along with, "(Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 실수해도 좋아 find the good parts". They managed to nail the melancholic and airy feeling quite well as well as the generous harmonisations throughout the sub 3-minute track.

They've improved a lot with ANTIFRAGILE and this is pretty much the release that made me really pay attention to their media in general. _Fearless_ was already a pretty good EP, albeit with a slightly weak lead single. This, however, is a great all-around record and ameliorates their debut release in just about every way.

**8.0/10**
