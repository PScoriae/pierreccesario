ANTIFRAGILE marks the group's sophomore EP release. Like _Fearless_ before it, there are 5 tracks on this record and each of them fill a certain role to diversify the selection – you'll see what I mean. The album art also follows a similar layout with the record title and LE SSERAFIM at the top and bottom respectively – makes it nice for you to display since they're all so uniform. What's changed, however, is the art itself. We see kintsugi. Gold kintsugi cracked across a snow white backdrop. Obviously, this is an ode to the the EP's title. It's pretty but at the same time understated – I like it. Another change is that the entire record is now available in Dolby Atmos and thankfully, its implmentation is good. It doesn't completely change the way the tracks sound but adds some depth and dynamism to the mix which is exactly how it should be done. HYBE is upping their budget eh?

_The Hydra_ is the intro track for this EP, much like how _Fearless_ starts with _The World Is My Oyster_, though I much prefer this. It features thick pulsating beats and a multitude of effects alongside snippets of each member speaking in Japanese, Korean and English. With its quality production, it gets you amped up and prepared for the upcoming tracks, especially _ANTIFRAGILE_. It only shows up in the first half of the accompanying music video (which is actually the trailer for the entire EP). The other half is sadly not on the tracklist but I would've loved to see it on there. It features the same high quality runway-like production but with Yunjin's lyricism and vocals. Anyways, it's a solid track.

Alright. The title track.

I'm gonna be honest, I was averse to this song when I first heard it. I felt like it was somewhat annoying and, for lack of a better term, pretentious. I gave it some time. "Maybe it has to grow on me," I thought.

It grew on me. With its distinctly reggaeton and funk percussions, _ANTIFRAGILE_ is full of energy and definitely not the tame track that _Fearless_ was. It is catchy. **Very** catchy. Lyrically, it talks about independence and strength which is clearly conveyed in the song and music video – there's a ubiquitous sense of determination. The chorus explodes onto the scene with this sound effect you'd hear in games like Tekken to separate itself from the constant Latin inspired beats. The entire group's vocal presence is also much improved with just as much vigour as the infectious melody. There are so many sections in the track that you can easily pick up and jam out to. Lyrics like _"잊지 마, 내가 두고 온 toe shoes"_ and _"무시 마, 내가 걸어온 커리어"_ which are nice references to Kazuha's and Sakura's backgrounds. The music video's chaotic attitude and choreography is a joy to watch, not to mention the polish that we've come to expect from HYBE. Hell, I've even noticed that it feels short since it seems like it abruptly comes to an end. This plays to its advantage, though. It's a subtle way to keep you wanting more – very clever. I'm listening to it while writing this review and I can't seem to take it off repeat.

_Impurities_ is the next track and fills the R&B role. We even get a dedicated music video with it. It's very glamorous and exhibits much more flowy choreography to mimic the track itself. Direction and cinematography are top class. Most of the picture consists of one-shot takes and the 35-second long take at 1:02 is downright impressive. It's not easy to do that especially when you have choreography involved, let alone of 5 people. The production one that genuinely satisfies the cinema-geek in me. LE SSERAFIM and team have clearly been working hard and I need to give credit where credit is due.

With _No Celestial_, we see the group's first foray into a more rock-focused track. Good ol' electric guitars and drums encompass this song and it even features some clapping and whistling to help break up the soundscape. It's a

**8.0/10**
