Welcome to my music review site!

I've always liked sharing music that I enjoy or find interesting with the people around me. Equally, I like reading reviews or hearing opinions about music that I enjoy. It's a pastime of sorts.

I think music is a great artform and shows an intangible characteristic of the artist or even the listener.

Seeing as I'm a developer, I figured that I would express my thoughts and opinions of my favourite music, songs and artists by creating a site and uploading reviews to the wealth of information that is the Internet.

You'll generally see reviews of my favourite artists' albums or anything audio related on this site.
