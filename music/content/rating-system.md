Right, so everyone has different rating systems and perceptions of what a score means. So, this page is designed to help you understand how I personally rate songs.

All works are rated on a scale of **0 – 10** and the final score can be seen at the bottom of a review.

The scale isn't 1 – 10 because that would mean that 5.5 is the average score. It makes more sense for 5 to be the average, hence the choice of 0 – 10.

0 would be something absolutely terrible that makes you want to gouge your eyes out and wish you had no ears at all. 10 represents the pinnacle of artistry. That's probably unachievable though – nothing is perfect but things can come close.

5, on the other hand, is an average song. Not 7. 5. Most songs nowadays are generally rated around a 7 and can therefore be defined as _average_, but what's the point of an 11 point scale if you're not going to use the full extent of its range with 5 as average?

Basically what I'm trying to say is that if I give something a 7, it doesn't mean it's average. It means it's pretty good and above average.
