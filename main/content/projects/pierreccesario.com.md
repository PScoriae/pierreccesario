# About

Essentially, this site is my .com, so it'll have everything that pertains to me and my career that I think you'll find important or fascinating whether you're a recruiter or someone getting to know me better. Since this website can also act as a platform for me to express my opinions about things, I may also post some reviews or opinion articles here too.

To get into the technical aspect of this website, it leverages the power of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static website and its HTML pages from source markdown files. All of this is automatically deployed with [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) from the GitHub repository using AWS services like [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) along with [Cloudflare's](https://www.cloudflare.com/) robust CDN and DNS.

## Accomplishments

- Developed a customised Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline that integrates with GitHub Webhooks to automatically run Hugo builds on AWS EC2 and deployments to AWS S3 buckets **(Hugo, Jenkins, AWS S3, AWS EC2)**
- Set up and configure Cloudflare DNS and CDN rerouting to AWS S3 buckets complete with TLS/SSL encryption for secure connections **(Cloudflare, AWS S3, Web Hosting)**
- Composed and formatted precise and informative documentation to aid understanding and deployment process of the project **(Documentation, Markdown)**
