## About

In its current state, this is a Kpop themed Discord bot that with features that appeal to Kpop fans.

Complying with Discord's announcement regarding _[Message Content Access Deprecation for Verified Bots](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Access-Deprecation-for-Verified-Bots)_, this bot only uses Slash Commands.
Though this change only applies to Verified Bots, I still want to use Slash Commands so that I hopefully don't encounter any headaches in the future.

Read the official full-fat documentation in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PScoriae/imyour_joy).
