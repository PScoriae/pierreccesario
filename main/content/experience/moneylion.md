## About

[MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com) was founded in 2013 with the belief that we all get ahead when nobody gets left behind.
We are here for the millions of Americans who’ve long been ignored — or even taken advantage of — by traditional banks.

We are rewiring the American banking system to make money more approachable and to give consumers a more accessible and sustainable path to their goals.

Welcome to MoneyLion, where the 99% can feel 100% about their future.

## Role

### Site Reliability Engineer II

The SRE team at MoneyLion operates as a dynamic and cross-functional global unit, committed to addressing the evolving needs of our primary stakeholders – the developers.

Our core mission involves continuously fortifying and expanding the resilience and performance of our infrastructure. We play a vital role in streamlining and accelerating the development process for our developers by actively identifying and resolving bottlenecks.

Our team is dedicated to fostering a robust and efficient development environment while ensuring the seamless operation of our technology stack — all while maintaining a strategic focus on tightening expenditure.

### Achieving price predictability and 55% cost-savings using Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized and optimized RI purchases

I’m excited and proud to have been part of a project where we reduced Aurora database costs by around 55% while maintaining performance. By migrating our I/O-intensive workloads to Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, we not only achieved significant savings but also improved price predictability through optimized Reserved Instance (RI) purchases, setting the stage for future workload migrations.
